Dear friends and family of Yonsei University,
Welcome to the celebration of our one-hundred-thirty-eighth anniversary
I would like to extend my gratitude to all of our honorable guests who have come to congratulate us, and to all friends and family of Yonsei who have joined us here today
I offer my special thanks to Chairman of the Board Hur Dong-soo of the Education Foundation, Yonsei University, and to President Kyung-sun Yu of the Yonsei Alumni Association for honoring us with their presence
Our school was founded one hundred thirty-eight years ago, upon the dedication and unceasing efforts of Missionaries Underwood and Allen
Now, Yonsei has become a global university committed to creating a sustainable future for mankind and pioneering in the fields of education and social engagement
Thank you, friends and family of Yonsei, for being with us on this long journey and encouraging us to take the leap forward
On this auspicious day, I would like to welcome all alumni and alumna who are here for their twenty-fifth and fiftieth Reunion
We hope this Reunion to be a special and proud occasion for you to witness how much your school has progressed
Please enjoy the opportunity to catch up with your fellow classmates and to share memories of your old days at the campus
This March, we had our first in-person matriculation ceremony after four years of online events
This was our starting bell, to which Yonsei is gearing up dauntlessly for the new challenges of the post-Covid-nineteen era
The pandemic has brought about fundamental changes in education, both overseas and domestic
There are serious inequalities in education and information, and equally serious gaps in learning
Furthermore, the emergence of a new group of Covid-nineteen-era learners has given universities the difficult task of reviewing and reconceptualizing existing educational paradigms
Yonsei, however, is transforming such crises into opportunities
We have already launched the first domestic online learning platform, LearnUs, which we have made also available for the general public, again for the first time in Korea
LearnUs will become an independent enterprise in the second half of this year
In this light, we have successfully created a global education platform that can radically innovate university education paradigms
Based on the educational expertise accumulated for one hundred thirty-eight years, Yonsei is developing outstanding online education content and technology that successfully engage with the challenges of the post-Covid-nineteen era mentioned above
As we are gathered here to commemorate our schools founding, I find that this may be the best moment to share Yonseis recent achievements with you
I proudly inform you that, last year, Yonsei was placed seventy-third in the QS World University ranking, and seventy-eighth in the Times Higher Education ranking
This sets an all-time high record, garnering the title of the best private university not only in Korea but also in all of Asia
We also achieved the most domestic first-place rankings in the evaluated academic fields
Such results would not have been possible without your love and support for your alma mater, and indeed not without the dedication and efforts of each and every member of the Yonsei community
Rest assured that we will continue to blaze the trail on our goal to becoming one of the worlds most respected universities
Specifically, we will invest unsparingly to reach the worlds top fifty schools in the short-term, and the top thirty in the long-term
I hereby ask the support and continued encouragement of the friends and family of Yonsei University
Esteemed friends and family of Yonsei,
We will not rest on our recent laurels In this post-Covid-nineteen-era, Yonsei will actively embrace the challenges of becoming a global leader, rather than be a mere follower of the generational trends
Not only must Yonsei evolve into one of the worlds most competitive universities, but it must also secure a sustainable future, by re-defining and overcoming the current crisis of uncertainty
In June, twenty twenty-four, we plan to introduce a one hundred twenty-seven-cubit quantum computer, referred to as a game changer because of its capacity superior to any of the existing super computers
Quantum computers are employed in many research areas, such as finance, cryptology, medicine, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology
Our Global Campus will be the site of Koreas first quantum computer, which will put South Korea fifth in line of nations possessing quantum computers, after the United States, Germany, Japan, and Canada
Research on quantum information technology and global research networks will be made possible through our use of quantum computing, and in turn this new quantum ecology will invigorate related industries and propel us further forward as a leading global research and industry partner
The need for industrial re-structuring centered on cutting-edge technology is ever on the rise
As daily life is itself undergoing digitization, new methods and technology in education in high-tech branches like semiconductors, and space to conduct convergence research and to develop cutting-edge technology are ever in demand
Yonsei Engineering Hall A was constructed in nineteen seventy-two, and ever since then, our four Engineering Halls have provided crucial space for education and research high-tech fields
Engineering Hall E is now under way, to further improve education and research environment in the field and to nurture the young minds of the post-Covid-nineteen-era, consolidating our position as a leading global institution in education and research
Yonseis medical science is already making its mark on the global scene
Since ten years ago, we have invested in advanced methods of training medical scientists, so that they may contribute to worldwide medical science and newly emerging bio-industries
To build on this initiative, we have recently established the Yonsei Medical Scientist Training Agency, to take the lead in both spheres of medical science and biomedicine
In addition, our biomedical category in the world university rankings is on a sharp rise, where accomplishments in international cooperative research were especially noticeable
Moreover, Yonsei University Health System has made a groundbreaking shift in cancer treatment, through the first domestic implementation of the Heavy Ion Therapy System
HITS will offer world-class cancer therapy with less side effects, within a shorter period
Also, Mirae Campus will benefit from an investment sum of seventy-three point five billion won in AI and semiconductor fields, and six point three billion won for developing remote medical care based on metaverse technology
Additionally, it will collaborate with Intel and Cambridge Universitys Milner Therapeutics Institute to open AI-based graduate programs in health and medicine, as well as to work on projects based on health and medical big data through the use of smart devices
Thus, Mirae Campus will be able to construct an international industrial-academical cooperation system, through the development of new medicine, digital healthcare, and mutual exchange of data
Educational edge has also been strengthened, as there was a recent increase of ninety undergraduate students, revolving around these high-tech studies
In order to guarantee Mirae Campus a sustainable development, it is imperative that we retain a stable source of liquid income
Therefore, a task-force team will be formed to propose, for priority review by decision makers, practical ways of utilizing Mirae Campus available space
Esteemed friends and family of Yonsei,
Yonsei pursuit of pre-eminence in higher education and research can only succeed when backed by bold investment
In twenty twenty-one, Yonsei Development Committee was organized by friends and family of Yonsei, to share the schools vision and support its long-term goals
Last year, seventy point five billion won was raised by YDC
This will go towards securing researchers of highest potential around the world, developing innovative platforms and educational content, and solving societal problems efficiently, grounded on our Christian spirit
twenty twenty-three will be the starting point for convergence research at Yonsei
In the near future, Project-Y Research Institute will be inaugurated to promote Yonsei convergence and innovation research, and further, systematically unify Yonsei research capability
They will receive customized support in accordance to the stages of research, such as the initial exploration of ideas, confirmation of the topic, and final execution of convergence research
Funds will be raised aggressively to cover the cost of research, and over sixteen point three acres will be allocated for research space
I myself will take the helm as the Director of IPY and fully mobilize the administrative and financial capacities of the university
As Yonseis president, I promise to continue this stride towards the greatness of Yonsei
Dear and esteemed friends and family Yonsei,
We face a period of uncertainty
More than ever in this post-Covid-nineteen-era, it is difficult to predict the future
Hence, I implore you to persevere with us in this challenging moment, until this task, placed upon us by Heaven, is completed
Please walk with us on this path to greatness, and let us witness together the bright tomorrow
Dear friends and family of Yonsei, who devote yourselves to the sustainable future of mankind, I pray that the Lords grace will always be with you
Thank you
